Summary Theory:

Lists: Ordered, mutable collections

Tuples: Ordered, immutable collections

Dictionaries: Key-value data storage

Sets: Unique, unordered elements

Functions improve reusability

Lambda functions are one-line functions

Recursion solves problems by self-calling

List comprehension simplifies loops

Data transformations are core to Data Science



Data structures are containers used to store, organize, and manage data efficiently.

Lists
✅ What is a List?

A list is an ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of items.

🔹 Characteristics

Allows duplicate values
Supports indexing
Can store different data types

🔹 When to Use

✔ When order matters
✔ When data needs frequent modification

Tuples
✅ What is a Tuple?

A tuple is an ordered, immutable (unchangeable) collection.

🔹 Characteristics

Faster than lists
Cannot be modified after creation
Supports indexing

🔹 Why Use Tuples?

✔ To protect data from accidental changes
✔ Used for fixed data

Dictionaries
✅ What is a Dictionary?

A dictionary stores data in key-value pairs.

🔹 Characteristics

Unordered (in older versions)
Keys must be unique
Very fast lookup

🔹 When to Use

✔ When data has meaning (labels)
✔ For structured data (JSON, databases)

Sets
✅ What is a Set?

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.

🔹 Characteristics

No duplicates
No indexing
Very fast operations

🔹 When to Use

✔ To remove duplicates
✔ For membership testing

Python Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

User-Defined Functions

🔹 Why Use Functions?

✔ Code reusability
✔ Clean and readable code
✔ Easy debugging

Lambda Functions
✅ What is a Lambda Function?

A lambda function is a small anonymous function written in one line.

🔹 When to Use

✔ Short, simple operations
✔ Used with map(), filter(), reduce()

Recursion
✅ What is Recursion?

A function that calls itself to solve a problem.

🔹 Key Rule

Must have a base condition to stop.

🔹 When to Use

✔ Tree traversal
✔ Mathematical problems

List Comprehension
✅ What is List Comprehension?

A shorter and cleaner way to create lists using loops.

🔹 Benefits

✔ Faster execution
✔ Cleaner code

Summary Theory:

Matplotlib is used for basic plotting.
Seaborn provides advanced statistical visualizations.
Scatter plots reveal relationships.
Histograms show data distribution.
Boxplots detect outliers.
Heatmaps visualize correlations.
Dashboards combine multiple plots for insights.




1️⃣ What is Data Visualization?

Data Visualization is the graphical representation of data to:

Identify patterns
Detect trends
Understand relationships
Communicate insights clearly
It converts numbers into meaningful visuals.

2️⃣ Matplotlib
✅ What is Matplotlib?

Matplotlib is a Python library used for:

Basic plots
Customizable charts
Publication-quality figures
It is the foundation for most Python visualization libraries.

## Line Plot

Used to show trends over time.

Bar Chart

Used to compare categories.

Histogram

Used to show distribution of numerical data.

Scatter Plot

Used to show relationship between two numerical variables.

Example: Experience vs Salary

Seaborn
✅ What is Seaborn?

Seaborn is built on Matplotlib and is used for:

Advanced visualizations
Statistical plots
Better design aesthetics
It works directly with Pandas DataFrames.

Box Plot

Used to detect outliers and distribution spread.

Pair Plot

Shows relationships between multiple numerical features.

Heatmap (Very Important)

Used to visualize correlation matrix.

When to Use What?
Plot Type 	      Use Case
Line Plot	       Trends over time
Bar Chart     	Category comparison
Histogram      	Distribution analysis
Scatter Plot	  Relationship between 2 variables
Box Plot	      Detect outliers
Heatmap	        Correlation analysis
Pairplot	       Multi-feature relationships

What is the difference between Matplotlib and Seaborn?

Matplotlib → Basic plotting, more control

Seaborn → Statistical plots, better design

What is a Heatmap?

A graphical representation of correlation matrix.

Why Visualization is Important?

Makes patterns visible
Helps in decision-making
Supports storytelling with data

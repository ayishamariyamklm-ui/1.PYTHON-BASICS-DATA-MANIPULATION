Summary Theory:

NumPy handles fast numerical operations using arrays.
Broadcasting allows operations between different shapes.
Pandas Series is 1D labeled data.
DataFrame is 2D structured data.
GroupBy is used for aggregation.
Missing values must be handled before analysis.
Data cleaning and aggregation are core data analyst skills.





1️⃣ What is NumPy?

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library used for:

Working with arrays
Performing mathematical operations
Fast numerical computation
Linear algebra operations
It is faster than Python lists because it uses optimized C code internally.

2️⃣ NumPy Arrays

A NumPy array is a multidimensional data structure.

3️⃣ NumPy Operations

NumPy allows element-wise operations.

4️⃣ Broadcasting (Very Important Concept)

Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations between arrays of different shapes.

1️⃣ What is Pandas?

Pandas is used for:

Data manipulation
Data cleaning
Working with datasets (like Excel tables)
Data analysis
It has two main structures:
Series (1D)
DataFrame (2D table)


2️⃣ Pandas Series

A Series is like a single column.

3️⃣ Pandas DataFrame

A DataFrame is like an Excel table.
